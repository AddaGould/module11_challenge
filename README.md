# module11_challenge

As with my previous challenges, whenever I run into an area in the code where I feel stuck I show it to chatGPT and ask for suggestions. Areas where I've directly pulled from chatGPT are noted with a # comment. Additionally, I also used a strategy I learned on Stack Overflow in part 2, it is also noted with a # comment.
